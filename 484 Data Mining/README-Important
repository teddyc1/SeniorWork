This folder contains my work for the data mining 484 course. 
Special Note: My PC died mid semester and I lost work. I've uploaded what I can. Acknowledging this catastrophe is important for why the quality of work
is so poor. Much of this entire course was finished via a laptop that was setup with kali linux, and really didn't play nicely with a lot of other school things.
