# SeniorWork
Late Junior / Senior level college work. 
All of this work is uploaded as it was turned in, for better or for worse. Special note: My PC died mid spring of 2021 and I finished that semester as well as my final semester on an old laptop that was setup for kali linux and personal projects. This laptop did not play well with many programs and I personally feel my work took a hit from the change in work space. 
Special Note: Due to the nature of operating systems (471) projects, none of the projects will be publically uploaded. If you wish to see my operating systems work please let me know.
